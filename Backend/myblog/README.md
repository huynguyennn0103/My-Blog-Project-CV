**Project Readme: Building a Blog Website BACKEND with Java Spring Boot, Spring Security, MySQL, Redis, Docker, JPA...**

---

## Introduction

Welcome to our blog website backend part! This document serves as a guide for developers who are interested in understanding and contributing to the development of our blog website built using Java Spring Boot, MySQL, Redis, and Docker.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to create a robust and scalable blog website where users can publish, read, and interact with blog posts. The website will be built using Java Spring Boot framework for backend development, MySQL for database management, Redis for caching, and Docker for containerization and deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK), Maven, MySQL, Redis, and Docker installed on your system.

4. **Configuration**:
    - Update application properties (`application.yml` or `application.properties`) with your MySQL and Redis configuration details.

5. **Database Setup**:
    - Create a MySQL database for the blog website.
    - Initialize the database schema using provided SQL scripts or Hibernate ORM (if applicable).

6. **Build and Run**:
    - Use Maven to build the project:
      ```
      mvn clean install
      ```
    - Run the Spring Boot application:
      ```
      java -jar target/<project_name>.jar
      ```

7. **Testing**:
    - Access the website locally using the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8080`) and test the functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Spring Boot**: For backend development and RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: For database management and storage of blog posts and user information.
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data and improving website performance.
- **Docker**: For containerization of MySQL database instance to simplify deployment.
